# Drone3D 

Drone3D is a C++ drone package used to rescue randomly distributed survivors based on Gazebo and ROS-1. This package adopted the drone controller program of [sjtu-drone](https://github.com/tahsinkose/sjtu-drone) and has beed tested in Ubuntu 18.04/20.04. Please **notice** that the current package is not guaranteed to work on older versions of Ubuntu.

The package first create a world with a drone landed at the centre red plate. Then multiple survivors are generated at random positions. The shortest route for traversing all survivors is calculated using RoutePlanner class. Drone would follow this route to visit each survivor and finally return to its initial position.

## Installation (for Ubuntu 18.04)
**Note**: use ROS-Melodic and Gazebo-9, otherwise there may be issues.
* ROS melodic desktop install, follow the instructions from [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu).
* Environment setup: 
``` 
echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
* Remove the previously installed gazebo, otherwise it will interfere with the current environment.
```
$ sudo apt-get remove ros-ROS_DISTRO-gazebo* # such as ros-kinetic-gazebo*
$ sudo apt-get remove libgazebo*
$ sudo apt-get remove gazebo*
$ sudo apt autoclean && sudo apt autoremove
```
* Install Gazebo-9 follow the instructions from [here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=install&tut=install_ubuntu&ver=9.0)
```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gazebo9
sudo apt-get install libgazebo9-dev
```
* Install gazebo-ros packages
```
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-gazebo-ros ros-melodic-gazebo-ros-pkgs  ros-melodic-gazebo-ros-control
```
* Install catkin
```
sudo apt-get install python3-catkin-tools python3-osrf-pycommon
```
* Create a workspace (anywhere you like, e.g., `~/catkin_ws`, but should keep the same for the current installation):
```
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```
* Install sjtu-drone in the above workspace:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/tahsinkose/sjtu-drone.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```

## Installation (for Ubuntu 20.04) 
* Desktop version of ROS Noetic: Follow the instructions in this [site](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu). Note one should do the "Desktop Install" and set-up proper environment variables.  
* Gazebo 11: Follow the instructions [here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu). Then install gazebo-ros packages: `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-gazebo-ros ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-control`
* catkin: `sudo apt-get install python3-catkin-tools python3-osrf-pycommon`, then create a catkin workspace described in this [site](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace).
* Ignition Citadel: Follow the instructions [here](https://ignitionrobotics.org/docs/citadel/install_ubuntu).
* sjtu-drone package installed in catkin workspace (eg. ~/catkin_ws), clone and install the package as the following:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/longfish/sjtu-drone.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```

## Cloning and compiling

Build this package in catkin workspace (must be the same as the one created in previous section):
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/longfish/drone3d.git 
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ catkin_make
```

## Running

Launch the Gazebo world in the 1st terminal:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch drone3d drone3d.launch
```

Simulate the survivor behavior and drone in the 2nd terminal:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ rosrun drone3d simulate
```

## Program structure

This package contains a Gazebo world plugin i.e., `SurvivorsPlugin`, and two C++ classes, i.e., `DroneObject` and `RoutePlanner`. It also contains `launch/drone3d.launch`, `urdf/sjtu_drone.urdf` and `worlds/survivors.world`, which are required components for simulating objects in Gazebo environment. 

In `SurvivorsPlugin`, a transport node is created to subscribe the survivor position message under the `/survivors/pose` topic published by the node in main() in `simulate.cpp`. After this message is published, it would then be subscribed by Gazebo to create the survivors in the simulated world. 

A ROS nodehandle is created in main() to create drones and control their behavior. The `DroneObject` class is created to ease the control of these drones. A shorest route that connect all survivors can be generated by the `RoutePlanner` class. 

## Rubric points

Following the Rubric points described in https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2533/view. Here only five criteria are listed to satisfy the requirements of Udacity.

* `Loops, Functions, I/O::The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures`: The package involves for... and while... loops and conditional expressions like if... structures. Expressions are also encapsulated into functions like the line-4 in simulate.cpp and the lambda like line-45 in route_planner.cpp.
* `Object Oriented Programming::The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques`: The package is divided into several classes. 
* `Object Oriented Programming::Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members`: Proper access specifiers are used in header files like `drone_object.h` and `route_planner.h`.
* `Object Oriented Programming::Class constructors utilize member initialization lists`: line-5 in route_planner.cpp.
* `Memory Management::The project makes use of references in function declarations`: e.g., line-4, line-36 in route_planner.cpp.
